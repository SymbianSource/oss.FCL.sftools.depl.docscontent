<concept id="GUID-6180B291-1862-5F1F-AF05-85E42B37B172" xml:lang="en"><title>Introduction
to dynamic arrays</title><shortdesc>Describes dynamic arrays.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>A number of classes are provided for constructing dynamically expandable
arrays in which the memory for the array elements is allocated from the heap.</p>
<p>The elements of an array can consist of any object, but in practice the
most common types are:</p>
<ul>
<li id="GUID-9D76EEA1-F186-56C8-89C1-87C53BA610F3"><p>pointers to <codeph>CBase</codeph> -
derived objects.</p> </li>
<li id="GUID-103A9CCE-B108-51B9-BD9E-BD6C389E5DF7"><p><codeph>T</codeph> type
and <codeph>R</codeph> type objects.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>The array classes are all templated; the template parameter defines the
type of object which is to form an array element.</p>
<p>An array can consist of elements which have variable lengths or elements
which all have the same length, depending on the specific class used.</p>
<p>Logically, each element of an array has a definite position within that
array but the physical organisation of the elements depends on the specific
array class.</p>
