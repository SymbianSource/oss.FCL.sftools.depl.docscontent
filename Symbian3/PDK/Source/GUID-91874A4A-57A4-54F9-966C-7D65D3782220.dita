Co-ordinate System</title><shortdesc>The co-ordinate origin of a window is its top left corner. Positive
co-ordinate values indicate positions to the right and down from the origin.
Negative values are also valid, and indicate co-ordinates outside the window's
extent. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p> <b>Variant</b>: Both (ScreenPlay and non-ScreenPlay). <b>Target
audience</b>: Application developers. </p>
<p>Each window has a position, which is the position of its origin relative
to its parentâ€™s origin. If its parent is a window group, then its position
is effectively relative to the top left corner of the screen or display device,
because window groups do not have a size. </p>
