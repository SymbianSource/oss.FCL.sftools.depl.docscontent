dialog and other application architectures</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The dialog-based architecture can be combined successfully with the
other architecture types as long as dialog-based views are only used at the
end points of the navigation structure. </p>
<p>Avkon supports view switching within an application and, more significantly,
view switching between applications. This feature raises issues for modal
dialogs, such as Avkon forms and queries. When there is such a modal dialog
open, possibly with new data entered, and another application view is switched
to (presumably by another application), then the data associated with the
open dialog may have to be disposed of.</p>
