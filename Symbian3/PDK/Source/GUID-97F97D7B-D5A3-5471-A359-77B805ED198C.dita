<concept id="GUID-97F97D7B-D5A3-5471-A359-77B805ED198C" xml:lang="en"><title>Design</title><shortdesc>Describes different modes of operations of the DMA Framework .</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Some DMA controllers provide several modes of operation. For example, one
ASSP provides both single-buffer mode and scatter-gather mode transfers. </p>
<p>There are two options: </p>
<ul>
<li id="GUID-EAFDBEFC-1524-55C4-BBD3-AF4CD88ADEF1"><p>Select a single mode
of operation. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-ED15AB92-3A9B-5968-A5C9-E49309F14EE1"><p>Select a multiple mode
of operation, and split the physical DMA controller into several logical controllers,
one for each mode to be supported. If this option is chosen, the PSL must
include one concrete controller class per logical controller; a controller
class is derived from <xref href="GUID-25398075-927B-36E4-B953-16785EC4086C.dita"><apiname>TDmac</apiname></xref>. </p> <p>If the DMA controller
supports more than one mode of operation, implement the simplest one first.
Implementing single-buffer mode first allows most of the the PSL (platform-specific
layer) to be debugged before you start to implement the more complex scatter-gather
functionality. </p> </li>
</ul>
<p>One reference implementation adopts a mixed strategy; the mode of operation
is selectable at build-time by defining the macro <codeph>__DESFETCHMODE__</codeph> to
exercise and demonstrate two different modes of operation. </p>
<p>Scatter-gather support is essentially a superset of single-buffer support
because a scatter-gather list is an ordered set of variable sized buffers,
and means that code shown here demonstrates the implementation of a scatter-gather
DMA controller. </p>
<p>Almost all modern MCUs use scatter-gather capable DMA controllers. Note
that we refer to descriptor fetch mode synonymously with scatter-gather mode,
as scatter-gather is implemented by passing the DMA controller a linked list
of descriptors describing the buffers to be transferred. Nonâ€“descriptor mode
requires that the DMA controller registers are programmed by software to describe
the buffer transfer required. Since each transfer must be handled by an interrupt
service routine triggered when the DMA controller has completed the transfer,
non-descriptor mode is not capable of performing transfers past buffer boundaries. </p>
