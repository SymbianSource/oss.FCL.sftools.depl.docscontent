service implementation discovery support</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><taskbody>
<context>       <p>For many service types it may be appropriate to build service
implementation discovery support. This will use <codeph>RApaLsSession</codeph> to
discover all applications that implement the service, decode their service's
opaque data fields from their application registration files, and present
the list to the client in a meaningful way. </p><p>For a chat service, this
could generate a list of service names presentable to the user in a list.</p><p>The
service discovery support must check the attacks from server applications
that pretend to be existing server applications, or prevent better server
applications from being discovered. Conflicts in selection could be presented
to the user, or automatic selections could be logged. The service discovery
support must reduce the amount of damage a malicious server application could
do through registration.</p></context>
