In a text object, a picture is represented by a single special character. You insert and manipulate pictures using function calls designed specially for that purpose.</p> <p>Because rich text handles pictures at the abstract <codeph>CPicture</codeph> level, there is no limit on the type of picture that can be included in rich text. Pictures may be drawn using only the GDI. To insert a picture, the Symbian OS application architecture is used to find available applications. To edit a picture, the application architecture finds the application which originally created it.</p> </conbody></concept>
