<concept id="GUID-CFC21A23-0299-4420-BB60-584D10C8913A" xml:lang="en"><title>Updating
the platform UID</title><shortdesc>This topic describes how to update the platform UID.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>When porting applications from S60 5th Edition to Symbian^3, you can include
the Symbian^3 platform UID in your application's <codeph>.pkg</codeph> file
and create a new <codeph>.sis</codeph> installation package using the modified <codeph>.pkg</codeph> file.
The platform UID for Symbian^3 is <codeph>0x20022E6D</codeph>.</p>
<note> If you do not include the Symbian^3 platform UID in your package file
and create a new <codeph>.sis</codeph> installation package, the user gets
a compatibility warning when installing the application. The warning may result
in the user canceling the installation.</note>
<p>To add Symbian^3 UID, include the following line in the <codeph>.pkg</codeph> file
of your application:</p>
<codeblock xml:space="preserve">[0x20022E6D], 0, 0, 0, {"Series60ProductID"}</codeblock>
<p>If you have verified that the same binary can be used on multiple Symbian
platform releases, you can include platform UIDs for multiple Symbian platform
releases in your package file as illustrated by the following example:</p>
<codeblock xml:space="preserve">;Supports S60 3.0
[0x101F7961], 0, 0, 0, {"Series60ProductID"}

;Supports S60 5th Edition
[0x1028315F], 0, 0, 0, {"Series60ProductID"}

;Supports Symbian^3
[0x20022E6D], 0, 0, 0, {"Series60ProductID"}
</codeblock>
<p>For more information and a list of the platform UIDs used in earlier Symbian
platform releases, see <xref href="GUID-FBA816FE-E188-4A40-9B9B-D47F7D3390AE.dita">Platform
UID</xref>.</p>
