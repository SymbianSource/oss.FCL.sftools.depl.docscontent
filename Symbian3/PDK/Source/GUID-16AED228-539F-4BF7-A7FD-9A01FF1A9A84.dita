locks in the code.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Locks are used to synchronize the data between threads in the kernel. They
can be also used to synchronize access to data in user side threads In SMP,
threads are executed in parallel, which means that if locks are not applied
to the code it could result in a race condition. Race conditions lead to system
crashes and data corruptions. </p>
<section id="GUID-6DA960AD-4E33-4B15-B960-F8077530AC88"><title>Locking Granularity</title><p>An
important property of a lock is its granularity. The granularity is a measure
of the amount of data the lock is protecting. There are two different granularities
for locks:</p><ul>
<li><p><b>Coarse-Grained Locks</b> enclose a large area of shared code or
multiple areas of unrelated data. The lock reduces the number of threads that
run concurrently resulting in serial execution making the code behave like
a single thread process. Coarse locks are applied in parallel. One lock can
be applied to each kernel subsystem.</p></li>
</ul><p>The following diagram illustrates how a Coarse-Grained Lock covers
many parts of code. It not only simplifies the locking action itself but also
frees developers from having to load all the members of a code in order to
lock them. In order to get concurrency in the operating system, the operating
system must allow more than one process (or interrupt) to execute at the same
time. To do this, we divide the OS into sections and give each section a lock.
For a small number of processors, we only need a small number of locks, each
covering a large region of the OS. This model of coarse-grained locking provides
good scaling on small numbers of processors.</p><fig id="GUID-D70A45BC-E281-403E-9D7F-519D990F0DAE">

</fig><ul>
<li><p><b>Fine-Grained Locks</b> enclose a small area of code for example
a data structure. These locks are added to the code and the user must remember
to release the lock. Fine locks are error prone. </p></li>
</ul><p>As the number of processors increases, the number of locks also increases.
The following diagram illustrates how fine locks are applied to data. In other
words, fine locks protect individual data structures or even parts of data
structures. All those locks add instructions and data.  To do this, we divide
the OS into sections and divide the section into small pieces of code and
apply lock for each piece of code. Fine-grained locking can result in near
perfect scaling.</p><fig id="GUID-97F40770-1B6C-435B-AFF0-3BA3AC66F7DA">

<li><p><xref href="GUID-FB1605A8-9946-364C-A649-DEF60E1F761B.dita"><apiname>TSpinLock</apiname></xref> is the lightest weight lock available
kernel side. If a process attempts to acquire a spinlock and one is not available,
the process will keep trying (spinning) until it can acquire the lock. Spinlocks
should be used to lock data in situations where the lock is not held for a
long time.</p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-669D0368-7ADE-35FA-881C-51D476D45B8A.dita"><apiname>RFastLock</apiname></xref> is the lightest weight lock available
user side. There is no priority inheritance. This is a layer over a standard
semaphore, and only calls into the kernel side if there is contention.</p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-C0FEA3A0-7DD3-3B87-A919-CB973BC05766.dita"><apiname>RMutex</apiname></xref> is used to serialize access to a section
of re-entrant code that cannot be executed concurrently by more than one thread.
A mutex object allows one thread into a controlled section, forcing other
threads which attempt to gain access to that section to wait until the first
thread has exited from that section.</p></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-AED27A76-3645-3A04-B80D-10473D9C5A27.dita"><apiname>RSemaphore</apiname></xref> is used for Inter Process Communication
(IPC), they are similar in performance to <codeph>RMutex</codeph>. <codeph>RSemaphore</codeph> locks
are used when the lock must be held for a long time. These locks put the thread
into sleep mode and are used to synchronize user contexts.</p></li>
