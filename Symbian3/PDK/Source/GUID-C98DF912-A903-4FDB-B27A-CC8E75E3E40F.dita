     <p>All interaction between user code and the driver code takes place
through a logical channel. On the user side, a channel is encapsulated by
a <codeph>RBusLogicalChannel</codeph> derived class; on the Kernel side, a
channel is encapsulated by a <codeph>DLogicalChannelBase</codeph> or a <codeph>DLogicalChannel</codeph> derived
class, constructed by the <codeph>DLogicalDevice</codeph> factory object. </p> <fig id="GUID-E27A3A17-366D-5551-A26E-FC8E0853D72A">
