Each drawing operation has a number of settings that affect its functionâ€”pen style, fill style, typeface, etc. Instead of passing these settings as parameters to every drawing function, the GDI API has the concept of a <b>graphics context</b> (<b>GC</b>) in which drawing functions are performed. The <codeph>CGraphicsContext</codeph> class is used to hold these settings and to provide all of the graphics functionality. </p> <p>The normal way of performing a drawing operation is therefore: </p> <ol id="GUID-B0F3020B-15C8-5A1E-AA44-9F2CB48A47A2"><li id="GUID-FC43F3A2-AD58-5F89-AD1B-82779741E965"><p>Set up a graphics context to hold the settings. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-0362DF4A-587A-587B-B4CB-689AF11E133D"><p>Call the graphics function of that context to perform the operation. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Graphics contexts are provided by graphics device objects that represents the medium being drawn to. The abstract base class for graphics device objects is <codeph>CGraphicsDevice</codeph>. </p> </conbody><related-links><link href="GUID-1C3455BE-2082-504D-9157-88D8C72B1B80.dita"><linktext>Graphics Device Interface
