<p>Universal indicator pop-up is touch-only component. It is activated by
tapping the universal indicators or the digital clock. It always includes
battery and connectivity indicators and digital clock. For each visible universal
indicator, there is one row reserved in the pop-up for displaying the icon
and the description text. Hence, the user can view the indicator displayed
in the Universal Indicator pane. The description text also informs the current
status and/or it may be a link to a view in corresponding application. For
example, by tapping the text “3 new messages” opens the relevant view from
the messaging application, tapping “Bluetooth active” switches view to the
Bluetooth settings. Content of the row is determined by the application originating
the indicator.</p>
