Editable, plain, global and rich text may be stored and restored. Formatting and content use different streams, which makes it relatively easy for a plain text or global text object to restore the (relevant) data from a rich text object.</p> <p>Pictures in rich text are stored using the pictureâ€™s own store and restore protocol, as required by concrete <xref href="GUID-829D57CD-9659-347B-AAE9-5F0A0ECD555C.dita"><apiname>CPicture</apiname></xref> implementations.</p> <p>The stream store is typically a file, but by allowing text to be restored into an already-existing document, support for two additional requirements is provided:</p> <ul><li id="GUID-F3840EAB-1923-5964-946D-24E2F93B24BD"><p>the clipboard: text may be copied to the clipboard (and then optionally deleted, to support cut), and pasted in from it</p> </li> <li id="GUID-ECD9124F-5050-5569-9C30-D1BC6D48A1A5"><p>undo buffers: a memory store may be used to hold inserted or deleted text, to achieve the effect of undo/redo</p> </li> </ul> <section><title>Storing and restoring</title> <p>Storing and restoring operations are optimised for efficiency for editable text. For instance, in rich text, <codeph>StoreL()</codeph> and <codeph>RestoreL()</codeph> may be used to store and restore the text content, its formatting, styles, fields and pictures in a single operation. Certain applications may want to store only certain parts of the text model; to save space, for example. Utilities are provided to store and restore certain components independently of each other.</p> </section> </conbody></concept>
