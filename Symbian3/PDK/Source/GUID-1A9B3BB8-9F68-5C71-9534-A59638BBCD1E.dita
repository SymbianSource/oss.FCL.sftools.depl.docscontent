<p><xref href="GUID-2D851BBB-15A1-309A-813D-E397D55A6431.dita"><apiname>TReal</apiname></xref> is a 64-bit double-precision type, used as the
argument type for all math functions, and the default type of floating-point
literals.</p>
<p><xref href="GUID-E694921E-0449-3B0B-81DC-5A9FCC07B345.dita"><apiname>TReal64</apiname></xref> and <xref href="GUID-58CA4B68-0A0F-31E2-A624-0F78F47EE458.dita"><apiname>TReal32</apiname></xref> are available
when the precise size is important.</p>
<p>Symbian platform floating-point arithmetic conforms to the IEEE754 specification.</p>
<p>Most Symbian platform implementations do not have hardware floating-point
support. As a result, floating-point arithmetic is noticeably less efficient
than integer arithmetic. It should be avoided unless demanded by the problem
type.</p>
