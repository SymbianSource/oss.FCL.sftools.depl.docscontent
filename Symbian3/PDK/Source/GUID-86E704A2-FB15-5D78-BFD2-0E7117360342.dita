Fields are designed to go into printer headers. As far as the content of a text object is concerned, fields are just a sequence of characters. The field data is maintained as a separate part of a plain text objectâ€™s data. The <xref href="GUID-2279727F-55BD-3D88-9E56-96B102F74E5C.dita"><apiname>CTextField</apiname></xref> class provides the base for fields.</p> <p>The field system is extensible: the <xref href="GUID-6202B0B7-663C-3172-BE13-88D77081B42C.dita"><apiname>MTextFieldFactory</apiname></xref> field factory allows new field types to be added to those already provided.</p> </conbody></concept>
