<concept id="GUID-9815224A-DDD6-5229-B0A4-117315438BD6" xml:lang="en"><title>Units
of measurement</title><shortdesc>In some locales, long and short distances may be expressed using
different systems of measurement. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>In Britain for example, imperial units are commonly used for long distances
and metric units for shorter distances. The <xref href="GUID-53299759-C2DD-3ABC-A055-9AFE7C5081C6.dita"><apiname>TLocale</apiname></xref> class
provides for this possibility by allowing the units of measurement, for long
(miles or kilometers) and short (meters/centimeters or feet/inches) distances
to be set independently.</p>
<p>For example, when setting the units of measurement in a locale where only
metric units are ever used, use <codeph>SetUnitsGeneral(EUnitsMetric)</codeph>.
In the UK, on the other hand, where short distances are often measured using
meters and centimetres, and long distances in miles, you may instead use <codeph>SetUnitsDistanceShort(EUnitsMetric)</codeph>,
and <codeph>SetUnitsDistanceLong(EUnitsImperial)</codeph>.</p>
