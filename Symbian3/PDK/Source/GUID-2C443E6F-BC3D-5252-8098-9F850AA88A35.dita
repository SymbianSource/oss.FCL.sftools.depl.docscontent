<section id="GUID-4BE363E2-E630-462D-A958-721B3636792E"><title>Architecture</title> <p>The
architecture of the Window Server varies depending on whether you are using
the <xref href="GUID-D93978BE-11A3-5CE3-B110-1DEAA5AD566C.dita">ScreenPlay (NGA)</xref> or <xref href="GUID-F64E6551-670E-5E12-8103-DE504D3EC94F.dita">non-ScreenPlay</xref> variant.
However, with a few exceptions, the client-side API is the same in both variants.
Both variants use an improved version of the Window Server, sometimes known
as <codeph>WSERV2</codeph>, which was introduced in Symbian^2 (Symbian OS
v9.4). </p> <p>The following diagram provides an overview of the Window Server
architecture in ScreenPlay. </p> <fig id="GUID-80DA5DEB-019E-5CE3-812E-496A1D713FFB">
<title>              The Window Server in ScreenPlay            </title>

</fig> <p>Below we list some of the key features of the Window Server, including
differences between the two architectures. The term <b>surface</b> is used
in ScreenPlay for a hardware-independent memory buffer for holding an image
or part of a scene. The <b>UI surface</b> is a special surface onto which
the Window Server renders all of the UI content. It is created automatically
during system start up. An <b>external surface</b> is any other surface—for
example, a surface that holds a video or to which OpenGL ES content is rendered. </p> <ul>
<li id="GUID-A56D68E9-99E0-528A-9DDD-977BECE50A45"><p>The Window Server has
a render stage framework, which enables the last stage of the Window Server
rendering to be customizable through plug-ins called <b> render stages</b>.
These can be chained to form a rendering pipeline, which takes the drawing
operations that are produced by the Window Server and ultimately passes them
to the UI surface. Render stages can selectively filter, modify, or redirect
the draw operation stream, as required—for example, to perform transition
effects (TFX). </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-A6589F28-B8B5-5FBA-B241-6E526D6A9BF1"><p>In ScreenPlay, composition
takes place in two stages. First, the render stages render the drawing to
the UI surface. Then the composition engine combines the UI surface and any
external surfaces into elements (sometimes called <b>layers</b>) and composes
them to the screen. This enables the composition to be performed in software
or hardware accelerator chips. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-BA8D10A1-F0CB-56F7-817B-F1425AC1DA56"><p>In the non-ScreenPlay
variant, the concept of surfaces is not used and the Window Server composes
directly onto the <b>frame buffer</b> which is then displayed on the screen. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-FC88013B-E5A4-5DD6-9906-A526D137CF43"><p>There are differences
in the plug-in framework APIs in the two architectures. In addition, in ScreenPlay,
fading effects are implemented by using render stages, whereas when ScreenPlay
is not enabled they are implemented by using a separate fader plug-in type
(not shown on the diagram). </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-86A8FB36-B9DF-50F2-AE0B-798D717899A6"><p>In ScreenPlay, the Window
Server provides advanced pointer features, such as support for multiple pointers
and proximity and pressure coordinates. The non-ScreenPlay variant does not
provide this support. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-46123A93-AF91-5FAB-995E-CDEAE9C8B961"><p>ScreenPlay provides
support for externally connected displays, such as TV-out. The non-ScreenPlay
variant considers the size of each display to be fixed. However, for High-Definition
Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and composite video connectors, there are a range
of resolutions that can change dynamically. ScreenPlay provides an optional
feature that supports switching between resolutions at runtime and notifications
to Window Server clients when there are changes to the resolution and connectedness. </p> </li>
</ul> </section>
<section id="GUID-2459A480-EC83-4595-97AA-D090331C9A88"><title>Building the
ScreenPlay and non-ScreenPlay variants</title> <p>To build the ScreenPlay

SYMBIAN_GRAPHICS_BUILD_OPENWF_WSERV
</codeblock><p>This causes the ScreenPlay versions of the components in the
Graphics package to be built in addition to the non-ScreenPlay components.
Specifically the <codeph>SYMBIAN_BUILD_GCE</codeph> macro causes the ScreenPlay
version of the Window Server to be built. This means that the <filepath>w32_nga.mmp</filepath> and <filepath>wserv_nga.mmp</filepath> files
are built. These define a second macro, <codeph>SYMBIAN_GRAPHICS_GCE</codeph>,
which causes the ScreenPlay Window Server classes to be built. </p> <p>To include the ScreenPlay versions when building
ROM, use the <codeph>SYMBIAN_GRAPHICS_USE_GCE</codeph> flag. </p> </section>
