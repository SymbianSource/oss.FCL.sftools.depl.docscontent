When one of the stakeholders does something to the surface, it usually means that another stakeholder needs to do something too. The Surface Update component provides a channel for the stakeholders to inform each other of changes. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody><p> <b>Variant</b>: <xref href="GUID-D93978BE-11A3-5CE3-B110-1DEAA5AD566C.dita">ScreenPlay</xref>. <b>Target audience</b>: Device creators. </p> <section><title>Purpose</title> <p>The Surface Update component provides a communication channel interface for use by components that render graphics content to <xref href="GUID-ADA8CECB-0E70-5B9C-8F36-0714AAF0CD13.dita">composition surfaces</xref>. Examples of such components are <xref href="GUID-DC8BFEF5-DA50-52DA-8CE2-5729A4A005F6.dita">EGL</xref>, the <xref href="GUID-D1F29744-EB92-5811-A735-B0BC1B352ED5.dita">video renderer (DevVideo)</xref>, the <xref href="GUID-36C3A2FD-F4F9-5B8C-91B7-40C29B3D2224.dita">camera viewfinder (ECam)</xref> and <xref href="GUID-2E8929E6-9555-51D2-B41D-6F1D05A4DB87.dita">render stages</xref>. This is illustrated in the following diagram. </p> <fig id="GUID-4916D92E-A639-52FD-9688-181216E0BD9E"><title>

The request includes the surface ID, the ID of the current buffer within the surface and optionally the following: </p> <ul><li id="GUID-A681DFDE-FC19-5200-B7A2-0F83170B4100"><p>The number of the screen on which the surface is to be displayed. Alternatively, the <codeph>KAllScreens</codeph> constant can be used to indicate that the request should be broadcast to all screens. This is called a <xref href="GUID-D2ECF215-B53C-5659-BA86-5B658C0C2D2F.dita">global surface update</xref> and its use is encouraged. It makes the client code simpler because it does not need to be concerned with which screen a surface is currently visible on. Note that you must not mix global updates with updates to specific screens within a single session. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-AE975674-48C9-54BB-B1F2-F246CF70DA62"><p>The region of the surface that has changed. This is sometimes referred to as the <b>dirty rectangle</b>. If the client does not specify this, the whole surface is recomposed. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The client can request notification of the following composition-related events: </p> <ul><li id="GUID-2BECDC59-1594-58B0-9F5C-7AD2D9150D4C"><p>The buffer has become available for rendering. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-2EA4C005-B42B-5DA4-8522-7F63E6DC7FD6"><p>The buffer has been displayed for the first time after the update was submitted.

This can be used to ensure that each frame gets displayed for at least a given period of time. </p> </li> </ul> </section> <section><title>Architecture</title> <p>The Surface Update component is an adaptation component, which means that it can be replaced by device creators to suit the exact hardware. The reference implementation consists of the Surface Update Server and its client-side API. The Surface Update Server runs within the Window Server process along with the composition engine. The Surface Update Server uses the standard Symbian client/server model for Inter Process Communication (IPC) to communicate with clients and Inter Thread Communication (using active objects and semaphores) to communicate with the composition engine. </p> <p>The client sends requests for composition through the <b>command channel</b> and the composition engine sends notification messages through the <b>notification channel</b>. </p> <p>The following diagram shows communication between the client, Surface Update server and composition engine. The composition engine is shown as a single component, although it can be implemented as multiple components. For example, the <xref href="GUID-8FE41C9A-8171-58A2-A808-17B81E79B11F.dita">OpenWF-C implementation</xref> consists of the OpenWF-C Support component and the OpenWF-C Engine component. The Surface Update Server in fact communicates with the OpenWF-C Support component, which in turn communicates with the OpenWF-C Engine. </p> <fig id="GUID-371C3037-3D9B-5647-A77B-B7624DFD66E8"><title>

Each composition engine must be registered with the Surface Update Server at startup. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-E08F7A3A-46BB-51FF-B9F2-5060DBB115E4"><p>Each composition engine instance has a unique 32-bit priority number, which represents the relative priority of its associated screen. The higher the number, the higher the priority of the screen. The composition engine instance passes this to the Surface Update Server at registration. The Surface Update Server adds the priority value to its priority list. After it is set up, the priority list is fixed and does not change when a screen becomes unavailable—for example, because it is put on standby or an external screen is disconnected. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-51786E9E-36DC-5459-BEF9-B3A59B8A58E0"><p>Each composition engine instance incorporates its own thread within the Window Server process. However, the external interface is accessed directly from the thread that makes the call. This means that <xref href="GUID-229099A4-EE8A-3EA7-8AA3-74ACE34ED1CD.dita#GUID-229099A4-EE8A-3EA7-8AA3-74ACE34ED1CD/GUID-64037182-167B-360C-B210-65B0861D4300"><apiname>MCompositionSurfaceUpdate::ContentUpdated()</apiname></xref> is called from the Surface Update Server thread. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-60224A78-8433-579C-9075-B8AFCD9D1924"><p>The Window Server's main thread is a client of the Surface Update Server.

For simplicity some detail is omitted. For example, the client typically renders to the buffer before sending it to the composition engine. This is not shown. Similarly the diagrams omit detail from the composition engine and some omit the Surface Update Server altogether. In addition, they assume that a specific screen number is specified. When global surface updates are in use, the sequence is more complex and is described in <xref href="GUID-D2ECF215-B53C-5659-BA86-5B658C0C2D2F.dita">Global Surface Updates</xref>. </p> <p><b>Surface buffer availability: single-buffered surface </b> </p> <p>When using a single-buffered surface, the client typically does the following: </p> <ol id="GUID-369D1CE5-DCDA-5764-9D72-6BF28BAEA5A5"><li id="GUID-61EEC7A6-A561-50E0-8EB2-2D80944D1A4F"><p>Render the graphics content to the buffer. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-FF4A8850-3E85-5A21-B155-1F559F50240B"><p>Call <codeph>RSurfaceUpdateSession::NotifyWhenAvailable()</codeph>. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-4108376B-5F0E-5C22-8654-F74663D61B97"><p>Call <codeph>RSurfaceUpdateSession::SubmitUpdate()</codeph>. </p> </li> <li id="GUID-A7523952-6551-542D-B501-604764F16D30"><p>Wait for notification that the buffer is available before rendering further content to it and repeating the cycle for as long as necessary. </p> </li> </ol> <p>This is shown in the following diagram. </p> <fig id="GUID-6A62814B-0493-5E94-9D26-0AC2897B1E4E"><title>

When single buffers are used, tearing artefacts are always a risk. Therefore double-buffered surfaces are often used. </p> <p><b>Surface buffer availability: double-buffered surface </b> </p> <p>When double-buffering is used, the client renders to one buffer (called <i>A</i> in this example) while the other buffer (<i>B</i>) is on the screen and vice versa.
