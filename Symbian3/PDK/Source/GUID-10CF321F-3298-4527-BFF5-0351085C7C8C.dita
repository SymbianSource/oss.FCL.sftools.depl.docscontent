<p>A list can only be composed of items of the same type. However, it is possible
to use some item types for different purposes. An example is a setting list
that contains an item for accessing a sub-list of settings. In this item,
the value box is omitted so that the item looks like a regular selection item,
and selecting it opens another list. Similar techniques are possible with
other double item types, too.</p>
