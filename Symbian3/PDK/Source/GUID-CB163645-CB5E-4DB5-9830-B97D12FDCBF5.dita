Control pop-up</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>In case the hardware has no dedicated volume keys, the audio volume is
adjusted using the Arrow up and Arrow down keys. When the user is controlling
the volume, the key event brings the Volume Control pop-up to the view, and
the pop-up disappears after a timeout when the user has done the adjustment.</p>
<p>The application may need up/down key events for controlling some other
component, such as list. In this case it needs to be decided whether that
view can be left without Volume Control or whether the Volume Control component
is accessed via the Options menu or toolbar.</p>
<p>In touch UI it is possible to activate Volume Control via universal indicator
pane. Volume is adjusted with touch by dragging the slider handle and audio
can be muted by tapping the icon in the UI component, refer to <xref href="GUID-BB8B3A11-0BBC-4759-A7F4-A28C9E70573F.dita">Touch
support for common UI components</xref>.</p>
<p>The Volume Control UI component may also be always available in the view.
In this case it is fixed in the layout.</p>
