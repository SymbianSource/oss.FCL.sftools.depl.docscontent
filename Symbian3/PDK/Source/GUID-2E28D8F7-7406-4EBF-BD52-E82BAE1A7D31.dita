favorite applications and services, as well as view at a glance if they have
missed calls or new messages. The home screen contains application shortcuts

<p>Home screen is the basic state of the device. Once the user has powered
the mobile device ON, it results in the home screen state after all the startup
activities have been finalized. The home screen state is the starting point
(home state) for users, from where they start their tasks. It displays information
about the current state of the device, including the connection status, battery
level, and network operator.</p>
<p>By default, the home screen displays predefined content. Users can add
to the home screen Web Runtime widgets and C++ applications that have been
enabled for the home screen. Users can also change the positions of the home
screen content.</p>
