Contents of Certificate Stores</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The list command is used to display the content of the certificate store.
It can be used to display the overall content of all certstore implementations,
to display the content of a specific certstore implementation, or to display
details about a specific certificate if its label is known. </p>
<p><b>Listing the content of all certstore implementations </b> </p>
<p>To see all the certificates available on the device, use the command: </p>
<p><userinput>certtool -list</userinput> </p>
<p>The output, depending on the actual certificates present on the device
will look similar to: </p>

Root5CA is a X509 format which is a Root (CA) type

<p><b>Listing the content of a specific certstore implementation </b> </p>
<p>If only the content of a specific certstore implementation is to be retrieved,
you can restrict the list command to that implementation using the –store
option. Suppose the content of the certstore implementation with index 0 (see
the section <xref href="GUID-F6C20181-0F03-5B8A-B548-C81FF8824503.dita">Working
with multiple certstore implementations</xref> for details on how to list
the available certstore implementations) is to be retrieved, issue the command: </p>
<p><userinput>certtool –store 0 –list</userinput> </p>
<p>Depending on the content of the certstore implementation with index 0,
output similar to the following is displayed: </p>
