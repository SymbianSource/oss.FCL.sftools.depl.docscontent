(Zsh) and Telnet Daemon</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Z Shell (Zsh) is a powerful UNIXÂ® shell ported for the Symbian platform.
It is a command interpreter for UNIX systems and has useful features of other
UNIX text shells, such as bash, tcsh, and ksh. </p>
<p>Telnet Daemon (TelnetD) and zsh run on the device. The combination of zsh
and TelnetD allows users to create and run a Unix-like shell on a Symbian
platform device using a PC (or similar) running a Telnet client as a remote
terminal. The connection is established using the IP address of the TelnetD
(device). </p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> All instances of the word <i>device</i> in this section refer
to a <i>production phone</i>. </p>
<p>This section describes the features of zsh and the commands that it supports.
It also provides information about TelnetD, which transfers characters between
the shell and a Telnet client. </p>
