Certificates</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The Symbian certstore allows two types of certificates to be imported:
root certificates and user certificates. </p>
<p>Please note that certificates must be in DER format to be imported. Also,
the absolute path to the certificate file must be given regardless of the
current directory in the shell. For example, if you are in the directory c:\temp
which contains mycert.der, to import the certificate you must issue the command: </p>
<p><userinput>certtool –import c:\temp\mycert.der</userinput> </p>
<p>A certificate always has a label associated with it. A label can be specified
during the import operation with the –label option, if this option is not
present, the full path to the certificate file is taken as label. Labels must
be unique within a specific certstore implementation. If a label is not unique,
an error occurs. For instance, if the certstore contains a certificate with
label abc: </p>
<p><userinput>certtool –list abc</userinput> </p>

<p>However, this happens because of the attempt made to insert the certificate
in a certstore implementation where the same label already exists. Certstore
implementation is not specified for use in a command. It is possible to insert
the certificate with label abc in the certstore implementation with index
1 (Index 0 is used by default). </p>

<p><b>Importing root certificates </b> </p>
<p>Root certificates typically belong to a certificate authority (CA) and
a number of them are present on a final product. Root certificates are used
to verify the authenticity of signed content. Root certificates are self-signed,
and often termed top-level certificates. </p>
<p>All the examples in the previous sections referred to root certificates. </p>
<p>A certificate is imported as a CA root certificate if and only if the corresponding
private key cannot be found in the keystore. </p>
<p><b>Importing user certificates </b> </p>
<p>User certificates belong to the phone owner. Using user certificate, the
phone owners can authenticate themselves. For example, during SSL/TLS, the
owner can perform client authentication. To import a user certificate both
the certificate and its corresponding private key must be stored in the Symbian
keystore. </p>
<p>If the private key corresponding to a given certificate is already present
in the Symbian keystore, the certificate will be automatically imported as
a user certificate. </p>
<p>Assume that the private DSA key corresponding to the certificate stored
in dsa_cert1.der is present in the Symbian keystore. The following command
imports the certificate as a user certificate: </p>
<p><userinput>certtool –label abc –import c:\certstore\data\dsa_cert1.der</userinput> </p>

<p>If the private key is not already present in the keystore, the same command
imports the certificate as a CA certificate. </p>
<p>Keytool can be used to include private keys in the Symbian keystore. Alternatively,
if you only want to include a user certificate, point to a DER-encoded PKCS8
file containing the key using the <codeph>-private</codeph> option. After
importing the key, <codeph>certtool</codeph> will make the owner of the key
as "WriteDeviceData", so that keytool will able to manipulate the key, performing
actions such as <codeph>remove</codeph> or <codeph>setuser</codeph>. </p>
<p>Assume the DSA private key corresponding to the certificate stored in <filepath>dsa_cert1.der</filepath> is
not present in the keystore and that the required DSA private key is stored
in pkcs8 DER-encoded format in the file <filepath>pkcs8dsa1.001</filepath>. </p>
<p><userinput>certtool –label abc –private c:\certstore\data\pkcs8dsa1.001
–import c:\certstore\data\dsa_cert1.der </userinput> </p>
