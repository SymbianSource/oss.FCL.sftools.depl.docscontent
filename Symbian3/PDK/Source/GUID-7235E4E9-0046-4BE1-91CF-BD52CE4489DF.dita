query</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>When there is need for a query that is longer than would fit one screen,
a message query can be used. A message query can contain a link text that
can be highlighted and opened.</p>
<p>By default the left softkey is OK, but with a link in the query the left
softkey opens the target view of the highlighted link text. The Selection
key also opens the link target view when the link is highlighted. Note that
there should be no more than three links in a single query.</p>
