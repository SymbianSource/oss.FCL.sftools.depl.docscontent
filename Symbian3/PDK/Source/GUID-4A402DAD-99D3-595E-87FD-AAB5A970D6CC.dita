Framework</title><shortdesc>This section describes the device driver framework and how to use
it to create a driver.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>It begins with an explanation of the main concepts and objects used in
device drivers: the channel objects that implement their interfaces, and the
factory objects that create these channels. This is followed by descriptions
of how to communicate with hardware devices by handling their interrupts,
and the platform security issues of which you need to be aware. </p>
<p>The section ends by presenting the source code to a simple example device
driver as a starting point for writing your own driver. </p>
