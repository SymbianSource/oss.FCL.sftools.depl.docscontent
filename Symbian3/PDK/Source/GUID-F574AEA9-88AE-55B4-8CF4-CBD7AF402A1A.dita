To allow USB devices to plug into Windows and handle MTP requests without installing software or requiring user interactions, device vendors must first implement Microsoft OS descriptor (MOD) in their user implementations. MTP over USB can then be enabled in two ways: by using the USB Manager and by writing an MTP client application. </p> </conbody></concept>
