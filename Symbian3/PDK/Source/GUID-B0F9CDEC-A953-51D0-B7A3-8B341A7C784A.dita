On desktop machines, it is conventional to refer to data on a disk file as persistent, because it persists after the machine has been turned off.</p> <p>Data in RAM is volatile, because it is lost when power is removed. On a Symbian OS phone, these distinctions are less clear (because the “disk” is itself in RAM). It is, nevertheless, useful to refer to data in files as persistent.</p> </conbody></concept>
