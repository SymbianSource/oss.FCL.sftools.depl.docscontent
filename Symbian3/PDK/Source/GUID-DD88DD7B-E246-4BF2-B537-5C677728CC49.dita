<p>Dialog architecture refers to a case where the dominant model for views
in the application is that of <xref format="html" href="specs/guides/Dialogs_API_Specification/Dialogs_API_Specification.html" scope="peer">dialogs</xref>. One particular case example of this is when the
main view is run as a <xref format="html" href="specs/guides/Dialogs_API_Specification/Dialogs_API_Specification.html" scope="peer">dialogs</xref>. <xref format="html" href="specs/guides/Dialogs_API_Specification/Dialogs_API_Specification.html#Dialogs_API_Specification.topic3.1.5" scope="peer">Multipage dialogs</xref> can be used to give a set of views in
