Driver Writing Guide Quick Start</title><shortdesc>Conceptual information that a developer should know before creating
a device driver.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>A device driver is a program that controls a particular type of device
that is attached to a base port. Writing a device driver requires an in-depth
understanding of how the hardware and the software of a given platform function.
The Device Driver writing guide tells you what you need and how to create
a device driver.</p>
