Palette Component</title><shortdesc>The Colour Palette component provides palette support to the GDI
and Font and Bitmap Server. A palette is a set of colors, which is a subset
of the full range of colors. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The Colour Palette was previously used to index the colors used on phones
that displayed a limited set of colorsâ€”for example, 16 colors. However, the
Colour Palette is no longer used in this way now that phones can display 16
million colours. </p>
<p>The CBR package name for the Colour Palette component is <filepath>graphics_palette</filepath>. </p>
