view inputs</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Split view mode inputs are opened similar to the full screen inputs. Virtual
ITU-T and QWERTY keyboards can be displayed in the split view mode. The application
can decide whether to use the full screen input or split view input.</p>
<p>Split view input uses the applicationâ€™s own editor field, and the application
remains partly visible when the input is opened. Applications have the responsibility
of keeping the editor visible while user is typing. When the input opens,
the status pane is hidden. Split view is closed by tapping the specific closing
button present within the input.</p>
