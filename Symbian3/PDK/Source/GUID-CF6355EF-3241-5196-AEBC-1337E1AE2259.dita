creating a sprite by loading a bitmap file</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p> <b>Note:</b> This example is designed to work properly only with Techview,
there is no guarantee that it will work properly with other interfaces. </p>
<section><title>Description</title> <p>The <filepath>BitmapSprite</filepath> example
creates an animated sprite by loading a bitmap (<filepath>.mbm</filepath>)
file. The sprite is a rotating windmill which can be moved around the screen
using the arrow keys. </p> <p>As in the previous example, the sprite is created
by setting up the sprite members to contain bitmaps, then appending them to
the sprite. In this example, however, the bitmaps are loaded from a file rather
than created using off-screen bitmaps drawn to using a graphics context. </p> </section>
