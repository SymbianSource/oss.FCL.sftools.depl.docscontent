<concept id="GUID-405F7AB8-0F0E-4171-95E6-3524D76917DE" xml:lang="en"><title>Handling
stylus pop-up menu events and commands</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>At the construction phase, <codeph>CAknStylusPopUpMenu</codeph> is given
a <codeph>MEikMenuObserver</codeph> object, which is usually a pointer to
the application’s UI (<xref href="jar:GUID-759FBC7F-5384-4487-8457-A8D4B76F6AA6.jar!/html/classCAknAppUi.html" format="application/java-archive"><codeph>CAknAppUi</codeph></xref>)
or another class that implements the interface. The stylus pop up menu will
grab the stylus event when one of its items is tapped on and it will then
report the item’s command ID to the menu observer. It is then up to the application
to handle the command in the implementation of <codeph>MEikMenuObserver::HandleCommandL()</codeph>. </p>
<p>When an item is  tapped, the menu calls its observer's (iMenuObserver)
ProcessCommandL. Typically the observer is application's AppUi. It is then
the observer's responsibility to handle the command appropriately. The observer
is informed with KErrCancel if the menu is closed without making a selection.</p>
