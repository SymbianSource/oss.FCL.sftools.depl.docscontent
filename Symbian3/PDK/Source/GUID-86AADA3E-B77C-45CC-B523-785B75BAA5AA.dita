<p>Mobile device users can use the Menu to access applications. Pressing the
Home / Menu key opens the Menu, where the user may browse and select an application.
The Menu was previously called <i>Application Shell</i> and the Home / Menu
key was called <i>Applications key</i>. In addition to direct access to applications,
related applications can be collected in folders.</p>
<p>Applications are presented as a grid of items by default. User can select
a customized version of the Menu layout, such as a list. The default grid
layout is 3 x 4 (portrait) or 4 x 3 (landscape), that is 12 icons. Pressing
the Selection key opens an application and closes the Menu.</p>
