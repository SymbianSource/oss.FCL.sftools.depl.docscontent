      <p>Once a logical channel and a physical channel, if appropriate, have
been created and initialised, the driver is ready to handle requests. </p> <p>On
the kernel-side, requests can be handled by one or more kernel-side threads,
allowing for rich and complex behaviour. Alternatively, if appropriate, a
request can be handled by code running in the context of the client user-side
thread, but running in supervisor mode. </p> <p>There are two kinds of request,
synchronous and asynchronous. </p>     </section>
