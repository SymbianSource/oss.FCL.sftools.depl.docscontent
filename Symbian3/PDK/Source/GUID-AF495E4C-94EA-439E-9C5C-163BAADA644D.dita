Multiple Simultaneous Privacy Requests</title><shortdesc>This topic describes how to design a Privacy Controller to handle multiple
simultaneous privacy requests.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p> An important design decision for a licensee in creating a Privacy Controller
is if it needs to process multiple simultaneous privacy requests when these
are sent via the <xref href="GUID-E1710E40-B8F5-5CF8-B9FE-698869A1770F.dita">Privacy
Request API</xref> or the <xref href="GUID-B3000A78-3BE5-5E0A-A718-87BC9BA03726.dita">Network
Privacy API</xref>. <xref href="GUID-D857413A-D5A1-5F9F-A780-C980A9E0BEE0.dita">Privacy
Controller</xref> describes the LBS administration setting <xref href="GUID-6D5954C5-3B6A-3BAA-AB75-D1ECE90BAEDB.dita"><apiname>KLbsSettingMaximumExternalLocateRequests</apiname></xref> that
controls if the LBS subsystem handles multiple simultaneous privacy requests.</p>
<p> If LBS is configured to support multiple simultaneous requests then the
licensee Privacy Controller must also be designed to handle them. This means
that the Privacy Controller must be written to process calls to <codeph>ProcessNetworkLocationRequest()</codeph>, <codeph>ProcessNetworkPositionUpdate()</codeph> and <codeph>ProcessRequestComplete()</codeph> for multiple requests and
it must track the state of each privacy request (uniquely identified by its
request ID). </p>
