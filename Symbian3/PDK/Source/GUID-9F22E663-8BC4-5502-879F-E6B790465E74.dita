This also means that import libraries for compatible ABIs are not created. </p> <p>If this is not used, you must supply a <filepath>.def</filepath> file with the frozen exports. </p> <p>Use of <codeph>exportunfrozen</codeph> is only recommended for the early stages of project development, when the Application Programming Interface is likely to be subject to change.</p> </conbody></concept>
