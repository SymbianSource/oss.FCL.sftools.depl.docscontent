to Insert Trace Points in a Component </title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Trace points can be added manually to trace specific-required events in
the source code or component at build time. </p>
<p>To instrument a component, the Instrumentor can use the methods given in
the <filepath>epoc32/include/e32utrace.h</filepath> file. The UTrace API provides
some basic information for each trace, but the Symbian developer has to define
the payload of the trace. It is recommended the Instrumentor is consistent
whilst adding traces in order to help the Trace Collector parse the trace
output once it is on the host. For example, being consistent while formatting
an Object ID or Object Name. </p>
