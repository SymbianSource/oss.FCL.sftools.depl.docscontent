scrolling pop-up</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Stylus scrolling pop-up component is used only to display scrolling indicators,
for example, page “1/3” of the editor or viewer.</p>
<p>The component used in stylus scrolling pop-up is <xref href="GUID-8EAF5A96-EB48-4A58-82D7-0583A22A51D0.dita">information
pop-up</xref>. The exact content of the stylus scrolling pop-up is specified
in applications.</p>
<p>The stylus scrolling pop-up can be used only when the scrollbar is used
with stylus. The stylus scrolling pop-up appears to the display when the user
is scrolling the content and a page break can occur to the scrolling. This
means that stylus pop-up is required only when there is more than one page
to scroll. The stylus scrolling pop-up disappears when the user releases the
scrollbar (stylus up event on the scrollbar).</p>
