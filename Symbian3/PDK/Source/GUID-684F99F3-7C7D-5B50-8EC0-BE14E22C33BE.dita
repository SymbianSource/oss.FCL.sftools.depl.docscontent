<concept id="GUID-684F99F3-7C7D-5B50-8EC0-BE14E22C33BE" xml:lang="en"><title>ROM
Compression of Executable Files</title><shortdesc/><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Both EKA1 and EKA2 both allow compression of files in non-XIP ROM images.
EKA2 can also compress executables in XIP ROM images. </p>
<p>When an executable file is built into the release directory, it is either
in a compressed or an uncompressed state, depending on whether the <codeph>compresstarget</codeph> or <codeph>uncompresstarget</codeph> keyword
is specified in the <filepath>.mmp</filepath> file that describes how the
executable is built. This does not change in EKA2. </p>
<section id="GUID-A1E4CBAE-46A8-5CCE-8C87-EC2E44CB4F7E"><title>Non-XIP ROM
image</title> <p>The general rule for an executable file in a non-XIP ROM
image is the same in both EKA1 and EKA2, i.e. the file is in the same state
as in the release directory, unless it is overridden by specifying the <xref href="GUID-D9FA2894-D7B6-58EE-AEE3-39E6BECF144E.dita">compress</xref> option on
the <codeph>ROM_IMAGE</codeph> keyword in the <filepath>.oby</filepath> file
that you pass to <codeph>BUILDROM</codeph>. (Note that this gets translated
to the command line option <codeph>â€‘compress</codeph>, and passed to the appropriate
tool: <xref href="GUID-77C17C57-6BC7-5C9F-9F2C-7DC57B45F774.dita">rombuild or rofs
build</xref> . </p> </section>
<section id="GUID-566898A8-4655-598F-8430-9E54B440F21E"><title>XIP ROM image</title> <p><b>EKA1</b> </p> <p>In EKA1, an executable file is always uncompressed in
a XIP ROM image. The uncompressed file has had all of its symbols resolved,
and can only be executed in its location within the XIP ROM. Files are specified
by using the <codeph>file</codeph> keyword in the <filepath>.oby</filepath> file.
The following diagram summarises the situation for EKA1. </p> <fig id="GUID-F781B307-B816-5E86-A92F-81A96D513451">

with all of its symbols resolved, and able to be executed in its location

<li id="GUID-6C573DBF-BF29-5BC7-A427-4818DB00A768"><p>in <i>uncompressed</i> form,
but with all of its relocatable information still present; this is specified
by using the new <codeph>fileuncompress</codeph> keyword in the <filepath>.oby</filepath> file. </p> </li>
