if feedback is supported</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>You do not normally need to check whether tactile feedback is supported
or not, as it is safe to call the API functions even if feedback is not supported.</p>
<p>However, in some cases using the area registry can require complex calculations
for e.g. at portrait/landscape mode changes. In case these calculations cause
too much overhead, you can use the <xref href="jar:GUID-759FBC7F-5384-4487-8457-A8D4B76F6AA6.jar!/html/classMTouchFeedback.html#c2b7967bf3d203ca223ea5d99647a2ef" format="application/java-archive"><codeph>TouchFeedbackSupported</codeph></xref> function to check whether
feedback is supported or not, and skip the calculations in case there is no
feedback at all.</p>
