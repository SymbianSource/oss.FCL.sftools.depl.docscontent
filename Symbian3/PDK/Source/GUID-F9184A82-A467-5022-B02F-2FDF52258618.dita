<concept id="GUID-F9184A82-A467-5022-B02F-2FDF52258618" xml:lang="en"><title>Session
Properties</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Both <xref href="GUID-651801A5-5473-3856-9647-46823598C5C1.dita"><apiname>RHTTPSession</apiname></xref> and <xref href="GUID-2E673024-239B-3965-8880-C47B7CC24EF6.dita"><apiname>RHTTPTransaction</apiname></xref> can
have a set of properties associated with them. Properties take the form of
name-value pairs, where the name is an <xref href="GUID-B886F0AA-DB9C-356C-9B96-33252820F93E.dita"><apiname>RStringF</apiname></xref> and the
value is a <xref href="GUID-DEE8279A-3BEC-316F-97B8-6C49FEDBD5B3.dita"><apiname>THTTPHdrVal</apiname></xref>, allowing integers, strings, URIs,
and dates to be stored. </p>
<p>Session properties are called Connection Information in the API, as they
mainly relate to the type of connection that is made between a client and
an HTTP server. They are accessed using the <xref href="GUID-651801A5-5473-3856-9647-46823598C5C1.dita#GUID-651801A5-5473-3856-9647-46823598C5C1/GUID-E2EAC2BF-8DB6-36C4-B922-C90235F3003C"><apiname>RHTTPSession::ConnectionInfo()</apiname></xref> method,
which returns an <xref href="GUID-5A5D8F2E-1646-3AB6-9964-EB26B3E4855D.dita"><apiname>RHTTPConnectionInfo</apiname></xref> handle. </p>
<p>Note that in general, session properties must be defined before the first
transaction is created; filters do not check the connection information if
the values have changed after this point. However, some exceptions are allowed
with HTTP version and proxy configuration. </p>
