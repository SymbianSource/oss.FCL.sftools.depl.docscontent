API guide</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The Cryptography API provides cryptographic services to the user software
through a standard Symbian platform interface. </p>
<p>In Symbian^3, a component called CryptoSPI has been introduced. CryptoSPI
manages the selection and loading of cryptographic algorithms. It also provides
a framework that allows device manufactures to implement additional
cryptographic algorithms as plug-ins. The legacy libraries (<filepath>cryptography.dll</filepath>, <filepath>hash.dll</filepath> and <filepath>random.dll</filepath>) are still supported. </p>
