indicators</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Universal indicators are small graphical icons. They inform the user about
issues such as unread messages, waiting voice mail, selected phone line, IR
and Bluetooth connection status, set clock alarm, home zone, and locked keypad.
Each status indicator has a priority number, which determines which icons
are displayed in case there are more of them than fit on the screen simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the Idle state and in the Phone application, the universal indicators
are displayed in the universal indicator area in the top-right corner (next
to the battery pane) in the status pane (see figure below).</p>
<p>Within applications other than Phone, status indicators appear in the universal
status indicator pane, which is combined with the clock display. Due to the
small size of this area, and also to avoid displaying unimportant things in
general, only the most important status indicators are displayed. </p>
