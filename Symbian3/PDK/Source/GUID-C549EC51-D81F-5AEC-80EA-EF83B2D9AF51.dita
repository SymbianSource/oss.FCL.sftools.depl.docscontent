<p>A heap simply consists of two lists of cells; one is the list of allocated
cells and the other the list of free cells. Each list is anchored in the heap
object.</p>
<p>A cell consists of a cell header followed by the body of the cell itself.
The body of the cell is the area of memory which is considered allocated.</p>
<p>The cell header is a struct of type <codeph>RHeap::SCell</codeph> defined
as part of the <codeph>RHeap</codeph> class in <filepath>e32std.h</filepath>.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a typical mix of free and allocated cells.</p>
