Quick Start</title><shortdesc>The Graphics package provides Symbian devices with a means of visual
communication. It is responsible for providing a system-wide interface with
the physical display(s) and handles input events from physical input devices
such as keypads and touch screens. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>There are two variants of the graphics architecture in Symbian^3. These
are referred to as <xref href="GUID-D93978BE-11A3-5CE3-B110-1DEAA5AD566C.dita">ScreenPlay</xref> (sometimes
also called the New Graphics Architecture or NGA) and the <xref href="GUID-F64E6551-670E-5E12-8103-DE504D3EC94F.dita">non-ScreenPlay
variant</xref> (sometimes called the non-NGA variant). The Graphics guide
documentation covers both variants. When the documentation applies to only
one variant, it is clearly stated at the top of the page. </p>
<p>The documentation is aimed at two separate
audiences, which we define as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li id="GUID-6DEE2E4F-C277-5C1D-B7DB-BE06FC6D73B1"><p> <b>Device creators</b>.
These are software engineers who are developing software that is embedded
on a device in such a way that end users cannot remove it in the normal operation
of the phone. Typically this software is built into ROM. This group may include
UI platform developers, system integrators, and creators of device drivers. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-CC9AD2AB-2B33-5C9B-B95B-1F145A26A281"><p> <b>Application developers</b>.
These are software engineers who are developing applications for ROM or after-market <xref href="GUID-AFE0238A-D6A4-5D07-BB99-85E8CF97BD26.dita">installation by using a SIS
file</xref>. </p> </li>
</ul>
<p>When the documentation is aimed specifically
at one of these audiences, it is clearly stated at the top of the page. </p>
<section id="GUID-7CED3F9D-72CC-4C2B-896A-68860CA9703E"><title>System Model</title> <p>The
following diagram shows the Graphics package within the Symbian^3 System Model.
The System Model is a high-level overview of the Symbian architecture. The
components are grouped to show their relationships to each other. Within the
Graphics package, components are grouped into collections, which are shown
as white boxes in the diagram. The Graphics documentation is organized according
to the System Model structure. </p><p>Although the System Model provides a
useful way of grouping the large number of components that make up the Graphics
package, it does not completely reflect the architectural relationships between
the components. </p> <fig id="GUID-73E547BA-5AC2-5B10-8422-3B8BA28E2D40">

two architectures, see <xref href="GUID-D93978BE-11A3-5CE3-B110-1DEAA5AD566C.dita">The
ScreenPlay Architecture</xref> and <xref href="GUID-F64E6551-670E-5E12-8103-DE504D3EC94F.dita">The
Non-ScreenPlay Architecture</xref>. </p> </li>

information about how to enable the two variants, see <xref href="GUID-6D8A1FC7-095B-587E-8274-23C132978C53.dita">Enabling
the Graphics Architecture Variants</xref>. </p> </li>
<li id="GUID-28824D17-7E98-57CD-B618-AFA2109E95D8"><p>The graphics architecture
enables device creators to take advantage of graphics processing hardware
when it is available, and to use software implementations when it is not.

for a number of APIs defined and administered by the Khronos group. These
enable the authoring and playback of dynamic media on a wide variety of platforms
and devices. For more information, see <xref href="GUID-50254C2F-57B6-58C4-911F-294EF2B79C04.dita">Khronos

key and pointer events in their applications. For more information, see <xref href="GUID-DC5E8C7D-D697-53E8-87F4-344301430E61.dita">Window Server Client-Side
