API</title><shortdesc>The Toolbar API is used for enabling quick access to functions
by displaying them in a toolbar.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>A toolbar contains AVKON buttons. The toolbar supports touch, and can be
with focus or without focus. It contains application-specific buttons (at
least three) that launch application-specific commands. The toolbar content
is application-specific, but you can choose whether the toolbar is displayed
in an application view or not.</p>
<p>The Toolbar API supports two types of toolbars: a fixed toolbar for touch
UI, and a floating toolbar which can also be used in non-touch UIs.</p>

<p>The fixed toolbar doesnâ€™t have focus, whereas the floating toolbar owns
the focus and it can be used also with navigation and selection keys. By default,
the floating toolbar owns the CBA buttons (<uicontrol>Select</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Close</uicontrol>)
but the floating toolbar can be defined as not having the CBA buttons with
suitable flags. </p>
<p>The toolbars are also located differently: a fixed toolbar has a permanent
place in the layout but a floating toolbar can be freely located when it is
defined as having a flexible position.</p>
<p>The toolbar extension is a toolbar button that expands the fixed or floating
toolbar. When the extension button is pressed, a grid of toolbar items opens
up. The extension items can be used as actual toolbar items. </p>
<p>The extension button itself looks like an ordinary toolbar button. The
only difference is that there is a default icon for the extension button that
is shown if the application does not change the icon itself.</p>
