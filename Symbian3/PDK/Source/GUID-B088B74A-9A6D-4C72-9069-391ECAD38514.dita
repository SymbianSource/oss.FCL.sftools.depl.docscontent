<p>Mobile devices support multiple communication methods, which in turn
sets high requirements for security. A mobile device with various connection
methods is exposed to a large number of attackers.</p>
<p>If you are developing a networked application, consider the following
scenarios and determine how to recover from them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The end user may lose network connection at any time or may
not be able to establish a connection at all.</p></li>
<li><p>A connection may pass over a public network, which may expose
the data if it is not encrypted during transmission.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer-to-peer connections are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks. To prevent this, use strong authentication and proper ciphering methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about communication with a mobile device, see the <xref href="GUID-8F2D6AC8-8357-55C7-970B-CD2684BA9B04.dita">Communications
Framework Guide</xref> section. </p>
