It only applies to WINSCW/WINS builds. </p> <p>Use it to give each DLL a different base address, so that the Windows loader does not have to do any relocation while loading Symbian platform and its DLLs. This considerably speeds up the initialisation of Symbian platform under WINSCW/WINS. </p> </conbody></concept>
