Symbian C++ code example demonstrates how to easily use the onboard camera
with zoom and autofocus, utilising an accompanying CameraWrapper made by Forum
Nokia. The Camera Wrapper supports all Nokia's S60 devices based on S60 3rd
Edition and newer, providing a unified interface for various Symbian and S60
camera APIs some of which have previously been Feature Pack specific or only
available via an SDK plug-in. The example application supports the use of
both the keypad and touch UI. The application can be self-signed, but it also
provides an option to use the dedicated camera key (Symbian signing required).
The example application replaces the separate examples published for S60 3rd
Edition, FP1 (S60 Platform: Camera Example with AutoFocus Support v2.2) and
FP2 (S60 Camera Example AutoFocus 3rd Ed FP2). For more detils, click this
