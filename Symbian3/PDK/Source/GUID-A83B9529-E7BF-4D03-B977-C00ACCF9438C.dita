the reserved lights</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><taskbody>
<context>       <p>The <codeph>ReleaseLight()</codeph> call releases the light
target if it was previously reserved for this client. Multiple lights can
be specified by using bitwise-or. If this client has not reserved any of the
specified lights, this method does nothing. Any reserved light targets that
are released and have no other suspended clients are reset to default state,
which is either lights ON or lights OFF, depending on system inactivity time.</p><p>The
following code snippet demonstrates how to release the reserved light targets:</p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">iLight-&gt;ReleaseLight( CHWRMExtendedLight::EPrimaryDisplay | CHWRMExtendedLight::EPrimaryKeyboard );</codeblock></context>
