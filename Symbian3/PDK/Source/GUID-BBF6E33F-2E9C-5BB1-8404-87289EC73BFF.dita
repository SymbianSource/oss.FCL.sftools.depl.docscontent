<concept id="GUID-BBF6E33F-2E9C-5BB1-8404-87289EC73BFF" xml:lang="en"><title>Multimode Telephony</title><shortdesc>The ETel multimode API enables access to common mobile telephony
services for a number of air-interface cellular standards or modes. It also
enables access to specialised services within the GSM and CDMA IS-95 standards
and provides an API that allows switching between supported modes. Currently,
GSM, CDMA (IS-95 and cdma2000) and WCDMA (3GPP rel '99) modes are the fully
supported modes. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>

<p>The API is designed to allow the more specialised services of future 3GPP
WCDMA releases to be added to future versions of Multimode ETel. Multimode
ETel is designed to provide client access to the services offered by phones
that run Symbian platform. </p>
