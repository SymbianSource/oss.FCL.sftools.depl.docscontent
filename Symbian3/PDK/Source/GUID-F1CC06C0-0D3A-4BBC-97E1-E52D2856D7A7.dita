<p>The standard functionality of the Find pane is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Characters typed from the numeric keypad appear at the end of the string
in the Find pane. </p></li>
<li><p>The user can only add and remove characters at the end.</p></li>
<li><p>The Find pane may be hidden until the user types in a character. </p></li>
<li><p>Whenever the find string changes, the list in the main pane is filtered,
and only the items matching the string are displayed. The user can browse
the list normally using the Arrow up and Arrow down keys.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Find pane can also be a pop-up window. In this case, it is only displayed
when it is specifically activated.</p>
