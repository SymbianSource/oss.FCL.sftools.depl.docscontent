Note that <codeph>TCheckedUid</codeph> is not part of the public API.</p> <p>The header is followed by the root stream ID. As the value of a stream ID is also the offset of that stream from the start of the host, this gives the offset of the root stream.</p> <p>The root stream ID is followed by all the streams; the root stream is the last stream.</p> </conbody></concept>
