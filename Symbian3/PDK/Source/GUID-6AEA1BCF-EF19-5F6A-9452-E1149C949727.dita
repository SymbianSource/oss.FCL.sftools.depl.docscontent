streaming CAF</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The Streaming Content Access Framework (CAF) provides a common interface
for applications to access streamed data. This section describes how streaming
CAF is used by a streaming player middleware such as MMF controller to view
and access the key stream. </p>
<section id="GUID-CF0A4C93-2EE6-54F3-A8E3-44384A941089"><title>Introduction</title> <p>The
streaming CAF identifies a suitable streaming agent, such as IPSec for accessing
the protected broadcast. The streaming agent decrypts the short-term key message
and uses it to decrypt the data. The streaming player middleware initializes
a key stream decoder for decoding a protected key stream. It is implemented
as a separate ECom plug-in. For more information, see <xref href="GUID-D5DDC05E-B8C6-5BF0-AEBA-EED1D88BB5BB.dita">CAF
