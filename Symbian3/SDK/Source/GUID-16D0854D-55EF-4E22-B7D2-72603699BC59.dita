<p>If there are no items to be displayed in a list or grid, the pane contains
a text informing the user about the empty list. The information displayed
in the list should be designed to provide as much help and guidance to the
user as possible. Instead of merely stating that a list is empty, the text
should point the user to some useful direction in the application in order
to add content.</p>

<title>Empty list: the primary font used for informing of an empty list (left),
the secondary font (right) used in addition to provide the user with further
information (used only in cases when genuinely useful additional information
is available)</title>

the first item for an empty list.</p>
