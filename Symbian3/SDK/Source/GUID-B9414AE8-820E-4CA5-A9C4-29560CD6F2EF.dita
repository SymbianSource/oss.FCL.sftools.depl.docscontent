<p>All Symbian applications must be signed before they can be installed.
All applications which use <xref href="GUID-6971B0A2-F79B-4E05-8AF3-BB1FC1932A22.dita">capability</xref>-protected
APIs, where the capability cannot be granted by the end user, have to be certified.
Such certification can be obtained through <xref href="https://www.symbiansigned.com/" scope="external">Symbian
Signed</xref>.</p>
<p>Signing is a means of encoding a digital certificate into the application
installation file. The certificate identifies the applicationâ€™s vendor, and
grants access to capabilities defined during the build process.</p>
<p>The signing process is described in detail on the <xref href="https://www.symbiansigned.com/" scope="external">Symbian
Signed</xref> website.</p>
<section id="GUID-B9414AE8-820E-4CA5-A9C4-29560CD6F2EH"><title>Signing options</title>
<p>If your application only needs <i>user capabilities</i> (<codeph>LocalServices</codeph>, <codeph>NetworkServices</codeph>, <codeph>ReadUserData</codeph>, <codeph>WriteUserData</codeph>, <codeph>UserEnvironment</codeph>, and<codeph>Location</codeph>),
you can self-sign the application.</p>
<note>
<p>When the end users are installing a self-signed application, they are
informed that the application is untrusted and may decide to abort the installation.
In Nokia E-series devices the user must change a setting to allow self-signed
applications to install.</p>

<p>Sign the <codeph>sis</codeph> <xref href="GUID-61EE2BE0-7B86-42CD-A03F-857DD8FAC246.dita">installation

to create the needed private key and, for example, <xref href="jar:GUID-35228542-8C95-4849-A73F-2B4F082F0C44.jar!/sdk/doc_source/ToolsAndUtilities94/Installing/IntroductionToSignSIS.guide.html" format="application/java-archive">SignSIS</xref> to
sign the application. Both applications are delivered with the SDK. For more

to sign a .Sis file with Self-Sign Certificate</xref> in the Forum Nokia
Developer Community Wiki.</p>
<p>The other signing options (Open Signed, Express Signed and Certified
Signed) are described in detail in <xref href="http://developer.symbian.com/ssguide" scope="external">The

<p>The UID value you need to use for your application depends on whether
your application is signed or self-signed.
