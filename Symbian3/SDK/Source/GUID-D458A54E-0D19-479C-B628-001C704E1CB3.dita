using links</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Links leading from one application (or the Idle state) to another application
may exist. Links are one-way shortcuts: there is no direct path back to the
state where the link was started; instead, the navigation inside the linked
application functions as if the user had manually activated the other application
and navigated to the target state.</p>
