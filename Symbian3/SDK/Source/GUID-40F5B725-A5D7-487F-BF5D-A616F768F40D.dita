notifications</title><prolog><metadata><keywords></keywords></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Soft notifications are reminders that inform the user of events that have
occurred in the user's absence, or while the mobile device user was busy with
some application. Text and graphics, can be used to communicate the message
to the user. Soft notifications are displayed in pop-up windows in the Idle
state.</p>
<p>The user can respond to the soft notification by using the softkeys. The
left softkey is used for activating a function, for example opening a message
that has arrived. The right softkey is used to discard the notification without
taking any further action.</p>

<p>Soft notifications are displayed only in the Idle state. If an event that
causes a soft notification (for example, a missed call) occurs when an application
is active, it may cause other kinds of UI events to notify the user, but if
the user does not react to these, the soft notification appears only after
the phone is put in the Idle state if the event still requires it.</p>
<p>The application that launched a soft notification can control it and also
discard it. It is possible to use the S60 key during a soft notification;
in that case, the soft notification disappears, but reappears when the user
returns to the Idle state, unless the application responsible for the notification
has discarded it.</p>
<p>Soft notifications can be displayed for the user in two different appearances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Ungrouped soft notification:</b> These notifications contain one
piece of information each. The appearance of the notification window is the
same as that of a note. The example in the figure below is an
ungrouped soft notification. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Grouped soft notification:</b> Many different items of information
can be combined into one soft notification where the items are displayed as
a list. The user can pick up one of the items at a time and react to it. The
appearance of this soft notification type is the same as the appearance of
a List query (see <xref href="GUID-7B275129-5EF7-4B27-B603-3BDE2C650A93.dita">Queries</xref>).</p></li>
</ul>

<title>Grouped soft notification. The height of the window is dynamic and
depends on the number of lines in the list.</title>
