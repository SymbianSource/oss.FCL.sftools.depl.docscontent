The Text Views API provide views of text objects on screen or printer, and enough information to allow these objects to be updated efficiently.</p> <p>Text Views provides the facilities to view and update text on screen, and to print. </p> <p>Viewing of text objects on screen is acheived by accessing the text object through a document layout interface, laying it out according to the requirements of its formatting and then displaying a view of the laid-out document.</p> <p>In association with printing, two preview modes are provided: one is a conventional preview of a full page on screen, the other, a mode referred to as WYSIWYG mode in which font metrics from a printer are used to display and edit text on the screen. Therefore, layout is identical with the printer's.</p> </conbody></concept>
