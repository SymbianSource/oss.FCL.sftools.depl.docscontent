<section id="GUID-5C773AFB-8332-4CB2-B811-E8029F79E284"> <p>HTTP represents
headers as a composition of parts and parameters. A simple header will have
only one part, for example: </p> <codeblock id="GUID-A82B0317-1A26-5903-8E71-00144572B193" xml:space="preserve">Location: www.symbian.org</codeblock> <p>More
complex headers consist of a number of parts, separated by semicolon (;) or
comma (,) characters. In RFC 2616, these are defined with the EBNF notation
'rule - A construct "#" is defined, similar to "*", for defining lists of
elements...' </p> <p>An example of a multiple-part header is: </p> <codeblock id="GUID-5A84BC7B-DDB4-59C2-9A94-6AB27B16E15A" xml:space="preserve">Accept: text/*, text/html, */*</codeblock> <p>The
three parts have values text/*, text/html and */* respectively. When setting
up a header like this, the client only needs to specify the parts, and need
not be concerned with separator characters. Separators are handled automatically
by the built-in header codec. </p> <p>Some header fields allow one or more
parameters to be associated with individual header parts. An example of a
header with parameters is: </p> <codeblock id="GUID-74FC7FC7-EC3A-55EF-840F-8952E13B1A80" xml:space="preserve">Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4</codeblock> <p>The Content-Type header has a single part (value 'text/html') that has a
single parameter (named 'charset', value 'ISO-8859-4'). Again, the client
need only be concerned with setting part and parameter values; the separators
including the '=' character are dealt with automatically. </p> </section>
