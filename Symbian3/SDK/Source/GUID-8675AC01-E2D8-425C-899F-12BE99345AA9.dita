and Machine Architecture</title><shortdesc>The C++ language, following its foundation in C, is close to the
machine architecture. This allows applications to be implemented efficiently,
but, especially for developers new to the language, presents some issues of
which you need to be aware. This topic reviews the basic language features
from this perspective, and discusses how the resulting issues are handled.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>

usually implemented as the natural machine word size of the particular implementation.
This is 32 bits in most modern machines. It was 16 bits in older machines,
and in a few machines it may even be 64 bits.     </p><p>Similarly, a pointer
(a <codeph>void*</codeph>, for instance) is usually implemented as a machine
word but, in some machines with special architectures, a pointer may be more
complex.     </p><p>It is assumed that Symbian is implemented on a machine
with a 32-bit or greater machine word, and 32-bit pointers. The types <codeph>TInt</codeph> and <codeph>TUint</codeph> are<codeph> typedefed</codeph> onto the built-in <codeph>int</codeph> and <codeph>unsigned int</codeph> types,
and are guaranteed to be at least 32 bits.     </p><p>When you need a specific
size, regardless of implementation, use a sized type. Several of these are
available: </p><table id="GUID-8E1CEF20-AF41-4980-AA56-5CBF2B7F6A9E">

</fig><p>Structures are regarded as <codeph>T</codeph> types: that is they
may not own heap-allocated resources such as <codeph>C</codeph> type classes.
    </p><p>An array contains many built-ins or other types </p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">TInt a[32]; // 32 TInts, = 128 bytes  
S b[3]; // 3 Ss, = 48 bytes </codeblock><p>The main disadvantage of using
C++ arrays is that there is no automatic checking of index values. For this
reason, and to support more complex containers, C++ has evolved the Standard
Template Library (STL). Symbian does not use STL, but provides its own range
of efficient container classes, for fixed, dynamic, and associative arrays.

take the address of an object, then you can refer to it by pointer:</p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">S* ps; // pointer to an S

is often a need to refer to memory as anything: for this, a <codeph>void*</codeph> pointer
is used in C++. In Symbian, a <codeph>TAny*</codeph> may be referred to instead.

<section id="GUID-51EBCCA6-8E19-43CC-819E-8A7F0560DE4C"><title>Strings</title><p>In C++, the basic string is an array of
characters:</p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">char* hello="hello";</codeblock><p>This statement
does two things: firstly, it sets aside six bytes of memory containing the
characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'. Secondly, it sets the pointer hello
to contain the address of the first of those bytes. </p><fig id="GUID-08C1AF40-8D93-414E-B103-1E57AB17480F">
<image href="GUID-512D0DA7-0BC2-534F-9233-11F46D285CA6_d0e7148_href.png" placement="inline"/>
</fig><p>Functions accessing the string rely on this address as its starting
point, and the terminating <codeph>\0</codeph> to indicate its end. Functions
which manipulate the string must either deliberately not extend it, or must
have some cue as to the amount of memory reserved for the string (beyond the
trailing<codeph>\0</codeph>) so they know how much it can be extended. This
leads to an awkward programming style, and every C++ library provides a way
to manipulate strings more elegantly. The Symbian platform solution is <i>descriptors</i>:
these are introduced in <xref href="GUID-9C51D27D-BEDB-59D1-8F0E-8426B8FF2230.dita">Descriptors</xref></p></section>
<section id="GUID-9D9ED4A6-5C8A-4369-BCFB-0082A3A97599"><title>Functions</title><p>Functions are a piece of code which can
be called and executed from anywhere else in a program. The stack is used
to pass parameters and to contain local variables. The stack is often augmented
by machine registers, especially in a register-rich processor such as the
ARM, so that memory is often not used. But, conceptually, there is a stack,
and for the purposes of this explanation it is convenient to consider the
stack as if it were implemented entirely in memory.   </p><p>Parameters are
passed by copying or evaluating onto the called functions stack frame. It
is bad practice to pass large parameters, such as an entire struct, or, in
fact, anything beyond two machine words in size, because this involves excessive
copying. Instead, a pointer or a reference should be used to pass the address,
instead of the data itself.   </p><p>In a multi-tasking system such as Symbian,
each thread has its own stack, which is a pre-allocated area of memory. Each
function then allocates its own frame from the stack on entry, and de-allocates
it on exit. The advantage of the stack mechanism is that allocation and de-allocation
are very rapid indeedâ€” just a couple of instructions. Also, the lifetime of
any variable on the stack is very well defined: it is the lifetime of its
owning function, or, in fact, its owning block, since functions may have blocks
within them.   </p><p>When a function returns, its stack memory is still there:
it is just not allocated. The stack memory will be re-used by the next function
that is called. A potential source of error is to allocate an object on a
functions stack frame, and then return a pointer to it: </p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">TEg* foo()
    {
    TEg s;
    TEg* ps=&amp;s
    return ps; // !! error !!
    }
</codeblock><p>This pointer will not be valid for long, because the memory
will be re-used when the next function is called. You should never allow this
to happen. This error is so obvious that a compiler will trap it. But it can
occur in more subtle forms: </p><codeblock xml:space="preserve">foo(CContainer* aContainer)
    {
    TEg s;
    TEg* ps=&amp;s
    aContainer-&gt;iMember=ps;
    }
</codeblock><p>These cannot be trapped so easily. </p></section>
<section id="GUID-19A4F40C-1177-4F71-B547-A00DE447CF55"><title>Heap</title><p>Each thread also has a heap. You can allocate
and de-allocate objects on the heap at will, and refer to them by pointer.
The benefit of a heap is that the lifetime of an object is entirely within
your control. This power comes with responsibility: you must not forget to
de-allocate objects once you have finished with them, and you must not use
pointers to objects that have been de-allocated. </p></section>
