<p>In the Symbian platform UI Control Framework, all UI elements (with a few
exceptions) are <keyword>controls</keyword>. A control is a rectangular area
of the screen that may respond to user input events. Buttons, menus, text
input boxes and application views displaying application-specific data are
all examples of controls. </p>
<p>All controls are implemented by deriving from the <codeph>CCoeControl</codeph> class.
Concrete implementations of controls are provided by a user interface library,
or by the application programmer. The control framework itself provides no
concrete controls. </p>
