<concept id="GUID-170EDC68-77C7-4FD9-A81E-C9F75698F7A3" xml:lang="en"><title>Implementing
support for scalable UI</title><shortdesc>For the correct control to receive touch events, you must implement
support for scalable UI.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>In Touch UI devices, supporting scalable UI is even more crucial than before.
Traditionally, the problem was that the application did not scale to fit the
screen size correctly.</p>
<p>For more information on scalable UI, see <xref href="GUID-B02C762B-C452-4184-ABEA-4753E6CD47D2.dita">Scalability</xref> section.</p>
<p>In Touch UI, there is also another consideration, the Symbian platform
may not receive touch events, or it may receive touch events for the incorrect
control, because there is a problem with knowing the correct location of the
touch event.</p>
<p>The following figures illustrate code required for handling scalable UI
events.</p>
