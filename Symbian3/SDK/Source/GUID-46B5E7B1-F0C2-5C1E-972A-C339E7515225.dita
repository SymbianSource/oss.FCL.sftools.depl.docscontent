In detail, the code and data sections of the executable are compressed with the Deflate, Huffman+LZ77 algorithm.</p> <p>Compression allows the stored executable to use less space on the file system. The executable loader decompresses the file when it is loaded.</p> <p>See also <xref href="GUID-1879BEEB-9945-55F4-817E-8D6117055B1D.dita">nocompresstarget</xref>.</p> </conbody></concept>
