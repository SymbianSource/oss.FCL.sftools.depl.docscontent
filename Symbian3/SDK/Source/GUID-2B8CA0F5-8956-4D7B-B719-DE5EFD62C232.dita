<p>Instead of a small graphic, column A (where used separately) may contain
a number. This can be used to indicate item numbers in lists where necessary.</p>

<p>Numbered items should be used only in lists where numbers are meaningful
and give added value. There is no specific functionality (such as shortcuts)
that all numbered lists would have.</p>
