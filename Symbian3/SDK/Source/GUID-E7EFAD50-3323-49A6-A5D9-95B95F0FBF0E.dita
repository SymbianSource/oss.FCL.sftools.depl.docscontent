<p>Preview pop-up is a floating component used for displaying more detailed
data about an item that has focus in the main pane.</p>
<fig id="GUID-443FE00D-6678-4951-9038-07C82D10B69E">
<title>Floating preview</title>
<image href="GUID-F07B3B53-0C4D-4472-8E00-34A4C8501C5E_d0e60397_href.png" scale="40" placement="inline"></image>
</fig>
<p>The preview is displayed with a 0.6 second delay after the focus is moved
(for example, scrolling down a list with the Arrow keys) to avoid too rapid
and continuous flicker. The default timeout for closing the preview pop-up
is the same as for the Information pop-up, but it is possible to adjust it
if necessary.</p>
<p>Preview pop-up contents cannot be scrolled and the component must not contain
any buttons or other elements that make it appear interactive: the component
is the same in both standard and touch-enabled devices and should the component
be used in a standard non-touch device, its elements should not look touch-enabled.
There can be a maximum of five text rows in a preview pop-up, and it is possible
to place a small icon in the start of the rows. It is even possible to have
more than one icon on a row instead of text, if necessary. The number of images
in a single preview pop-up is limited to one, and it can be accompanied by
up to two rows of text.</p>
<p>Preview pop-up shows always duplicate data in a given application to ensure
that the user will not miss any content or functionality even if a given product
does not utilize preview pop-up (that is, it has been switched off). Owing
to the special nature of preview pop-up, it is important to thoroughly consider
its genuine usefulness in various applications. Furthermore, the component
should not be confused with the Information pop-up note even though the data
displayed in these two components can at times be identical.</p>
<section><title>Preview pop-up in a touch interface</title><p>Preview pop-up
is a floating component used for displaying more detailed data about an item
that has the focus in the main pane. It is not a touch-only component, and
its basic functionality is described above. Although it is not recommended
to place buttons or other items that appear touch-enabled into the preview
pop-up, it is still possible to give some items touch-only functions. It is
up to each application to decide whether to make use of this support in some
sensible way. For example, a tap on a www hyperlink displayed in the preview
pop-up would open Browser and open the Web site in question. However, it should
be noted that using touch-enabled items in the preview pop-up is an advanced,
heavy-user feature.</p><p>A tap on an item in the preview pop-up can also
open the stylus pop-up menu, when there is no obvious direct function for
that item. For more information, see <xref href="GUID-C4E728B4-3E84-49A4-83CB-DF146420D78A.dita">Stylus
pop-up menu</xref>.</p></section>
<section><title>Preview pop-up for touch only</title><p>The above section
describes the general case for touch and the preview pop-up. There is, however,
a variance possibility for the preview pop-up, which is to limit it strictly
for touch. In this case, the guideline for having no buttons or other obvious
touch items in the preview pop-up can be ignored for the most part: if the
preview pop-up can only be opened with a stylus, it is perfectly acceptable
to make touch functions plainly touch-enabled.</p></section>
<section><title>Using preview pop-ups
in C++ applications</title><p>The API to use for creating the preview pop-up
component is the Information
preview popup API.</p><p>Preview popups can be used in two modes: in
the default mode where the popup is hidden automatically as a result of timeout
or input event (either a key press or a pointer event), or in permanent mode
where the popup stays visible until it is dismissed by the application code. </p><p>For
implementation information, see Using
the Information Preview Popup API. </p></section>
