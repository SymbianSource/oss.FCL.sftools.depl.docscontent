layering</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The Symbian platform uses the principle of format layering
in which new formatting is added as a layer onto the previous layer of formatting.
The following diagram shows a less efficient technique for applying format
layering to text. The inefficiency arises because each format layer stores
not only the new attribute which it introduces, but also every attribute which
it inherits from the preceding format layer. </p>

</fig>
<p>The Symbian platform avoids this inefficiency by using the system of <keyword>based-on
links</keyword>. Here, each new layer adds attributes in a natural way without
restating all attributes previously set. A based-on link is a pointer to the
format layer whose attributes are inherited by another layer. For example,
when the italic attribute is applied to a region of bold text, the new layer
stores only the italic attribute and a pointer to the previous attribute layer.
Chains of format layers can thus be formed, with each layer based on the previous
one. In order to determine a character or paragraphâ€™s <keyword>effective format</keyword>,
a chain of format layers must typically be examined. The final layer in the
chain of based on links is the one whose based on link is NULL and is not
therefore based upon any other layer.</p>
<p>This method is demonstrated in the following two diagrams, in which each
arrow represents a based-on link.</p>

<p>The following diagram demonstrates the system of based-on links when attributes
are applied to different parts of text rather than added on top of existing
attribute layers.</p>
<fig id="GUID-1E0E17F0-BE93-5403-8474-ED612E118C8F">

</fig>
<p>In this case, several format layers are required, all of which are based
on the normal layer.</p>
