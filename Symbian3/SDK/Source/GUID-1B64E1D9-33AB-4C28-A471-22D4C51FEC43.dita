<p>Tooltip is used for providing brief hint about an item, to explain the
user’s tasks for the item selected by the user.</p>
<p>An <xref href="GUID-8EAF5A96-EB48-4A58-82D7-0583A22A51D0.dita">information pop-up</xref> is
used to display the tooltip.</p>
<p><b>Design recommendation</b>: Tooltips must not be used for items that
might open a stylus pop-up menu with touch down and hold. </p>
<p><note>It is an application's responsibility to design all required texts
for their tooltips.</note></p>

<p>Tooltip appears when the user touches down and holds on an item, that has
a tooltip designed, for at least 0.3 seconds. It also appears from a dimmed
icon, as it would be displayed in “normal” situation. Tooltip disappears with
touch release, when the focus is moved to another item or when the user touches
down some other item that does not have a tooltip.</p>
<p> There is no touch interaction with the tooltip item.</p>
