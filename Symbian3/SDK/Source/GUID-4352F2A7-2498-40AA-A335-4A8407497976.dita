interaction style</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The basic interaction principles of the Symbian platform in the bottom
softkey style remain similar to the legacy Symbian UI style. This applies
to keypad functions, typical functions of the keys, navigation (both in terms
of hierarchies, and the scroll and select behavior), and so on.</p>
<p>As in the legacy UI style, the scrolling in the software follows the visual
direction of the respective scroll keys.</p>
<p>Similarly, other visual UI controls of scroll keys rotate together with
the UI. For example, this applies to the Volume Control component which is
vertical also in landscape mode.</p>
<note><p>In some product concepts, using the Numeric keys and some of the
navigation keys may be disabled while in the bottom softkey mode. This may
mean that some applications or features (such as editing) are not usable at
all in one of the modes.</p></note>
