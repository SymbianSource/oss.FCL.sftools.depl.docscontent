Security settings are simply whether authentication, authorisation, and/or encryption are required or not. </p> <p>Note that the API only deals with incoming connections: for outgoing services, see <xref href="GUID-4F0C4B9D-AA42-59C4-900A-7045FEAAF2F4.dita">How to use security on outgoing sockets</xref>. </p> </section> <section><title>Architectural relationships</title> <p>The API uses the <xref href="GUID-D0D27AEA-FDDB-5F6F-94F6-ADDF5910DC47.dita">client/server</xref> framework. The API provides <codeph>R</codeph> classes that send requests to a server process that stores and manages security information. </p> </section> <section><title>Description</title> <p>Before using the security manager, clients must open a session to it using <xref href="GUID-B7CBABF9-93A1-3275-9CB0-CDF8A6606BB1.dita"><apiname>RBTMan</apiname></xref>, and then a subsession using <xref href="GUID-D536FA83-2535-3BF2-AC0D-EA0C7CA806BA.dita"><apiname>RBTSecuritySettings</apiname></xref>. </p> <p>A security settings object, <xref href="GUID-BC29B643-2CE8-30C1-BF41-4D2B5585DC81.dita"><apiname>TBTServiceSecurity</apiname></xref>, is used to set whether authentication, authorisation, and/or encryption are required. </p> </section> </conbody></concept>
