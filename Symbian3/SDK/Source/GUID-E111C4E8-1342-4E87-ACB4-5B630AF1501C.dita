and localization</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>You need to take internationalization concerns into account as early
as possible when designing your application. This section describes internationalization
and localization, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-457CC544-EC3B-4863-A5C4-DC7046614929.dita">Locale-sensitive
data types</xref></p>
</li>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-9EA7B72B-8394-48B8-A0CC-4BB34CBDB01C.dita">UI text
strings</xref></p>
</li>
<li><p><xref href="GUID-88917386-AD48-4C76-A1C7-46F0B1E85A18.dita">Implementing
UI text localization</xref></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When localizing your application, there are two different concerns that
you need to manage in your project. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Date, Times, Currency, and other locale-sensitive data types</p>
</li>
<li><p>UI text strings</p></li>
</ul>
