<concept id="GUID-ACF69260-D643-4709-8DAB-33FD92940F86" xml:lang="en"><title>Hierarchical
application structures</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>When browsing within a hierarchical application structure, the Symbian
user interface offers direct access from one folder to another (sibling) folder
in the same level. The Arrow left and Arrow right keys are used to accomplish
this. The Navi pane displays the sibling folders as tabs.</p>
<fig id="GUID-A99BF5A7-9D80-4CBA-A078-5992079E6728">
<title>In this example, each displayed state is a folder containing a list
of items. State 1 contains three folders (1-1, 1-2, 1-3). When the user has
opened one of these, there is a possibility to move directly into the other
two folders without first going back to state 1. Folder 1-1 contains two sub-folders
and folder 1-2 contains one.</title>

</fig>
<p>This additional navigation feature can be interpreted as a shortcut between
sibling folders. For navigating hierarchical application structures, the basic
navigation rules are applied, noticing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Moving from one folder to another has no effect on the function of
the Back softkey in these views: from all of them, the Back function leads
to the previous hierarchy level. </p></li>
<li><p>The navigation shortcuts can only be applied when there is no other
use for the Arrow left and Arrow right keys in the state.</p></li>
</ul>
