Specify the entire filename, e.g. <filepath>euser.lib</filepath>.</p> <p>The keyword indicates libraries which are only required in debug builds; this situation can arise when complex functions are called from <codeph>__ASSERT_DEBUG()</codeph> macros, for example in the <codeph>TSwizzleCBase</codeph> constructor which calls a function in <filepath>estor.lib</filepath>.</p> <p><filepath>makmake</filepath> constructs two lists of libraries, one for debug builds and the other for release builds. The <codeph>library</codeph> keyword contributes to both lists, but the <codeph>debuglibrary</codeph> keyword only contributes to the debug list. There is no support for libraries which are only used in release builds.</p> </conbody></concept>
