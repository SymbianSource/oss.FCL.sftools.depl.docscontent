items from the choice list</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>You can use the method <codeph>CAknChoiceList::RemoveItem()</codeph> to
remove items from the choice list. </p>
<p>However, you must be very careful with this. Removing an item will change
the item indexes of the following items, and the client application is responsible
for keeping track of item indexes. For details on how the items are indexed,
see <xref href="GUID-845F3021-E3ED-4676-916A-75740886DCBD.dita">Using the Choice
list API</xref>.</p>
