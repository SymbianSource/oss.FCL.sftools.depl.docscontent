architecture</title><prolog><metadata><keywords></keywords></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>Dialog architecture refers to a case where the dominant model for views
in the application is that of dialogs. One particular
case example of this is when the main view is run as a dialog. Multipage dialogs can
be used to give a set of views in conformance with the Symbian UI concept.</p>
<note>
<p>Nested dialogs can use quite a lot of stack space if not written carefully.</p>
