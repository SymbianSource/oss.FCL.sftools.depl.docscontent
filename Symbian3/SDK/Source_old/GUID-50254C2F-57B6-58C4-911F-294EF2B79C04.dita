API Support </title><shortdesc>The Symbian platform provides support for a number of APIs created
by the Khronos Group (www.khronos.org). This is a member-funded industry consortium
focused on the creation of open standard, royalty-free APIs to enable the
authoring and accelerated playback of dynamic media on a wide variety of platforms
and devices. This topic provides a brief summary of the Khronos APIs that
are supported in the Symbian platform. </shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<section id="GUID-4C797D3C-7500-4E05-8207-FD15D60DCA6C"><title>Supported APIs</title> <p><b>OpenGL ES </b> </p> <p>OpenGL
is a 2D and 3D graphics API that provides a broad set of rendering, texture
mapping, special effects, and other visualization functions. It gives software
developers access to geometric and image primitives, display lists, modeling
transformations, lighting and texturing, anti-aliasing and blending. OpenGL
ES is a subset of OpenGL optimized for 2D and 3D graphics on embedded devices
such as mobile phones. </p> <p>See: <xref href="GUID-AB93B01C-B6C2-5B24-ADEF-95706584D625.dita">OpenGLES
Collection</xref>  </p> <p><b>OpenVG </b> </p> <p>OpenVG is an API that provides
a low-level hardware acceleration interface for rendering vector graphics
libraries such as Flash and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). OpenVG is targeted
primarily at handheld devices that require portable acceleration of high-quality
vector graphics for user interfaces and text on small screen devices. It does
this while enabling hardware acceleration to provide smooth interactive performance
at low power levels. </p> <p>See: <xref href="GUID-1B1C6D35-FFDF-55B3-BCE2-DD0295858E49.dita">OpenVG
Collection</xref>. </p> <p><b>EGL </b> </p> <p>EGL is an interface between
Khronos rendering APIs such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG and the underlying native
platform window system. </p> <p>See: <xref href="GUID-8C6D4350-A38D-57A1-8C8D-C777EA7E8A3E.dita">EGL
Collection</xref>  </p><p><b>OpenWF Composition</b> </p> <p>OpenWF Composition
(OpenWF-C) provides a hardware abstraction layer that allows power-efficient
hardware-accelerated composition on a wide variety of hardware platforms.
OpenWF-C is particularly aimed at systems with limited memory bandwidth, such
as mobile devices. OpenWF-C enables the UI and the window system stack to
be independent of the hardware used to achieve the composition. OpenWF-C is
a system-level API that can be ignored by application developers.</p>  </section>
