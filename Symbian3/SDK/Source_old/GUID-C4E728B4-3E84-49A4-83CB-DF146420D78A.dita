pop-up menu</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>The stylus pop-up menu is a separate pop-up mainly used when a view cannot
offer dynamic functions, and the pop-up only offers tap-enabled functions.
The stylus pop-up menu can also be used directly on top of applications. For
example, on an image in Browser, the stylus pop-up menu can be used for offering <uicontrol>Save
asâ€¦</uicontrol> and similar options.</p>

<title>Stylus pop-up menu opened from a preview pop-up. A tap on any other
name or even anywhere else on the screen closes the stylus pop-up menu without
moving the focus. </title>

<p>Activation of the stylus pop-up menu can be done with a short or long tap,
which ever suits the given application and situation the best. Background
is not dimmed when the stylus pop-up menu is shown. The menu disappears automatically
after six seconds (or as soon as the user selects an item or taps outside
the pop-up area).</p>
<p>As the purpose of the component is only to offer some primary functions
(a maximum of six functions), the stylus pop-up menu is not a scrollable component.
Thus it has no focus.</p>
