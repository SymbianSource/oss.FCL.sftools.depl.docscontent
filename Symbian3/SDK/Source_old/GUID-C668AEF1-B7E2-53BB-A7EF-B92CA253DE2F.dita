closure of a handle</title><shortdesc>This document describes how to make a handle not closable.</shortdesc><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>A handle may be marked as not closable. This is an obscure but important
property of handles and their associated Kernel objects.</p>
<p>A handle is marked as not closable when the handle-number has the enumerator <codeph>CObjectIx::ENoClose</codeph> ORed
into it. For example, the current thread is always marked as not closable.</p>
