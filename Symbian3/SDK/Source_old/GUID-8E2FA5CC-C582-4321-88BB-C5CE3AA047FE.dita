changes in bi-directional languages</title><prolog><metadata><keywords/></metadata></prolog><conbody>
<p>If the display text language is following right-to-left writing direction
(numbers are still left-to-right in bi-directional languages), also the standard
panes change their places, and content can be mirrored if needed. The general
rules for layouts in bi-directional UI languages are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li id="GUID-73433B79-FED1-481F-BF31-4DBF1C7BEF23"><p>The Status pane components are mirrored e.g. the signal and battery
panes change their places.</p></li>
<li id="GUID-098A0CDB-2DB1-4285-85A3-A49FAF792B09"><p>The main pane lists and grids are mirrored: the A column icons and
texts are on the right rather than on the left, etc.</p></li>
<li id="GUID-0F7210EA-6C23-4B44-B439-02A5BD865DF5"><p>The Control pane is not mirrored: the left softkey (typically Options
or a positive selection) remains on the left, and the right softkey (typically
a negative command such as Back, Exit, or Cancel) remains on the right.</p></li>
</ol>
